# This repository is deprecated and replaced by [light-kafka](https://github.com/networknt/light-kafka) for Event Sourcing and CQRS with Kafka Streams and Interactive Queries. 

An eventual consistency framework implementation based on event sourcing, CQRS and Kafka on top of light-4j.
It is based on the open source project [eventuate-local](https://github.com/eventuate-local/eventuate-local) from Chris Richardson

When building microservices, there are two major patterns are used for service to service
communication.

## Synchronous, Request/Response Communication

In light-4j, this means to use [Client](https://doc.networknt.com/concern/client/)
module to call other services in the request/response fashion regardless light-rest-4j,
light-graphql-4j or light-hybrid-4j is used.
 
## Asynchronous, Message-Based Communication

The eventual consistency framework light-eventuate-4j is designed to facilitate asynchronous
communication between services built on top of light-rest-4j, light-grahpql-4j and
light-hybrid-4j. Service communication is through events and every service maintains its own
aggregates to serve consumer independently.

## Which Style to Choose

For pros and cons of each communication patterns, please see [here](https://doc.networknt.com/style/light-eventuate-4j/comm-pattern/)


## Why light-eventuate-4j 

For microservices implementation, developing business transactions that updates entities owned
by multiple services is a challenge, as is implementing queries that retrieve data from multiple
services; For complicated application that has too many services interact with each other, it is
essential to choose asynchronous message-based style for service communication and transaction
management with eventual consistency. 

Once you've decided that asynchronous message-based communication is best for your use case, you
need to make some architecture decision to choose the best of combination of frameworks to build
your microservices.

Light-eventuate-4j is the best framework to enable messaging-based service communication. It is
based on event sourcing and CQRS on top of Kafka message broker. You can build your services
with light-rest-4j, light-graphql-4j or light-hybrid-4j and they are all seamlessly integrated
with light-eventuate-4j framework which provides event store and event producing and consuming
client for services built on top of other light-4j frameworks.


## light-eventuate-4j components:

- light-4j, light-rest-4j, light-graphql-4j and light-hybrid-4j provide platforms to build microservices in REST, Graphql and Hybrid/RPC style.

- Mysql for event store to persist events

- Zookeeper is used to manage Kafka cluster

- Apache Kafka is used as message brokers for publishing/subscribing events

- A console/admin UI to monitor the message broker and communication between services

- A hybrid command server to host all hybrid command services in case light-hybrid-4j is used

- A hybrid query server to host all hybrid query services in case light-hybrid-4j is used
 
- A RESTful CDC server that is responsible to publish events to Kafka from event store if light-rest-4j is used.
  
- A hybrid CDC service that is responsible to publish events to Kafka from event store if light-hybrid-4j is used.
